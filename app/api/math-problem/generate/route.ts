const DIFFICULTY_INSTRUCTIONS = {
  easy: `
DIFFICULTY: EASY (Foundational Level)
- Use WHOLE NUMBERS ONLY (no fractions or decimals)
- Maximum 2 computational steps
- Operations: Addition, subtraction, or simple multiplication/division
- Numbers should be within 100
- Very straightforward wording
- Example: "A hawker stall sold 45 chicken rice plates in the morning and 38 in the afternoon. How many plates were sold in total?"
`,
  medium: `
DIFFICULTY: MEDIUM (Grade-Level Appropriate)
- Can use simple fractions (denominators ≤ 12) or decimals (up to 2 places)
- 2-3 computational steps
- Operations: All four operations, simple percentages (10%, 25%, 50%), basic fractions
- Numbers within 1000
- May require one conversion or intermediate step
- Example: "A bookshop gave a 25% discount on a $48 storybook. How much did Sarah pay after the discount?"
`,
  hard: `
DIFFICULTY: HARD (Challenge Level)
- Can use mixed numbers, improper fractions, or decimals up to 3 places
- 3-4 computational steps
- Operations: Ratios, rates, percentages, volume, area, multi-step reasoning
- Numbers within 10,000
- Requires careful planning and multiple steps
- Example: "A rectangular tank is 80 cm long, 50 cm wide, and 60 cm tall. It is 3/4 filled with water. How many litres of water are in the tank? (1 litre = 1000 cm³)"

${DIFFICULTY_INSTRUCTIONS[difficulty]}

SYLLABUS TOPICS FOR PRIMARY 5:
- Fractions: Mixed numbers, multiplication, division
- Decimals: Up to 3 decimal places, four operations
- Percentage: Finding percentage of a whole, discount, GST (9%), simple interest
- Ratio: Simple ratios (a:b), dividing quantities in ratio
- Rate: Speed, unit rate problems
- Whole numbers: Up to 10 million, four operations
- Area: Triangle, composite figures (rectangles, squares, triangles)
- Volume: Cube and cuboid (cm³, relationship with litres)
- Angles: Properties of triangles, angle sum
- Money: Singapore dollars and cents
- Time: Hours, minutes, duration problems
- Length & Mass: Metres, centimetres, kilograms, grams

SINGAPORE CONTEXT - Use realistic scenarios like:
- Shopping at NTUC FairPrice, Giant, or neighbourhood shops
- Hawker centers and coffeeshops (chicken rice, laksa, drinks)
- MRT/bus travel and fares
- HDB estates and playground dimensions
- School activities (class fundraising, field trips, sports day)
- Singapore money (dollars and cents, using $)
- Singapore measurements (metres, litres, kilograms)

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Choose ONE topic from the syllabus above
2. Create a realistic Singapore scenario
3. Follow the ${difficulty.toUpperCase()} difficulty guidelines above
4. Answer must be a single number (whole number or decimal up to 2 places)
5. Include appropriate units (e.g., $, m, cm², litres, kg)
6. Avoid ambiguous wording - be clear and direct
7. Use Singapore spelling (e.g., "metre" not "meter", "colour" not "color")
8. **CLASSIFY** the problem into ONE of these categories:
   - "Whole Numbers" (basic arithmetic with whole numbers only)
   - "Fractions" (involves fractions, mixed numbers)
   - "Decimals" (decimal operations without money context)
   - "Percentages" (finding percentages, discounts, interest)
   - "Ratios" (ratio problems)
   - "Rates" (speed, unit rates)
   - "Money" (Singapore dollars and cents calculations)
   - "Time" (time duration, clock problems)
   - "Length & Mass" (measurement problems)
   - "Area & Perimeter" (area, perimeter of shapes)
   - "Volume" (volume of 3D objects)
   - "Geometry" (angles, shapes, properties)
   - "Mixed Operations" (uses multiple unrelated concepts)

⭐ HINT GENERATION REQUIREMENTS:
Generate THREE PROGRESSIVE HINTS that help students WITHOUT giving away the answer:

**Hint 1 - Conceptual Understanding:**
- Help identify what the problem is asking for
- Clarify what information is given vs. what needs to be found
- Guide understanding of key concepts or vocabulary
- Ask guiding questions like "What do we need to find?" or "What information do we have?"

**Hint 2 - Strategic Approach:**
- Suggest a problem-solving strategy or method
- Break down the problem into smaller steps
- Recommend which operation(s) might be useful
- Guide thinking WITHOUT showing calculations

**Hint 3 - Method Nudge:**
- Give a gentle push toward the solution method
- May mention specific formulas or relationships
- Can suggest the order of operations
- Still does NOT show actual calculations or reveal the answer

CRITICAL RULES FOR HINTS:
- ❌ NEVER reveal the answer or intermediate calculations
- ❌ NEVER say things like "multiply 5 by 3" or "the answer is..."
- ✅ DO guide thinking and strategy
- ✅ DO use encouraging, age-appropriate language
- ✅ DO scaffold learning progressively (each hint should build on the last)
